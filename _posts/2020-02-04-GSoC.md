The conda-forge updating bot  quickly became a crucial part of conda-forge's infrastructure. Because of that the code needs some hardening" (testing and re-factor) to make it more reliable and less prone to break with updates.

Here are some ideas towards that goal:

1. Separate git logic from filtering and migration logic.

   Currently the filtering and migration logic (which is common to regular and mini migrators) is coupled to the git/github logic via the class structure. We might consider separating this. This would make testing simpler, since we could test the git logic independently of the actual migration logic. It would also reduce the amount of code we keep.

2. Refactor `auto_tick.py`
   It would be great to refactor auto_tick.xsh. I the main thing that needs to happen is the break up of the run function. Since it does everything, from cloning the bot's fork to issuing the PR we have rather limited opportunities to parallelize parts of the execution. For instance, we might make all but the GH API bits run in parallel, since they are mostly IO bound. However, we want to limit our exposure to the GH API so we don't run into timeouts and such.

3. Make the usage of "bad" in the case where we fail to retrieve versions consistent  
   with the other uses of "bad" which use dicts

4. Cleaning up the code

   Write documentation, API docs, move R specific things to compiler rebuild, etc.

5. Commit JSON after every feedstock PR issued?

6. Integration testing

   Run true integration (with a dev graph to boot) so we don't blow up the graph by accident and can run CIs with close to 100% coverage.

7. Separate IO from computation

   There are a few examples in the code where computation and IO are merged (for instance get_attrs in make_graph). These should be separated with IO performed elsewhere if possible. This will help the functions be more atomic and enable more workflows than the current workflow (eg pulling feedstock information from a local dir)

8. Auto pin PRs

   It would be nice if the bot issued a migration PR if it issued a version bump PR for a pinned package that caused the version to move out of the run_exports supported range. This PR then could be accepted or rejected, without requiring a human to make the PR. This would also help shift control of the ABI compatibility ranges to the maintainers of the feedstocks themselves, as changes to the run_exports and versions would automatically result in a migration proposal. Finally this would help with pins that we are missing, for example arrow-cpp was missing a pin until recently despite declaring a run_exports.

9. Render meta.yamls with conda_build_configs

   Currently we aren't performing full renders of all the meta.yamls for the feedstocks. This means we miss any variables that are defined inside the configs. For instance mumps defines the various mpi backends in the config, causing us to miss it in mpich migrations.

10. Check CDN for packages in addition to PR status

    This way we don't face plant into not yet live packages.

11. Finish migration with PR into pinnings conda_build_config.yaml

    It would be great if we could have the bot issue a PR against the pinning feedstock, updating the global pins once a migration was done (for some definition of done). Done could mean that all the prs have been merged, which would be implemented as the pinning feedstock having all packages as host deps and a special case in the migrate method. Other definitions of done could also be created, eg if all PRs have been issued or if all PRs have been issued and the packages with the most decedents have been updated, etc.
