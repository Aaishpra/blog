The conda-forge updating bot  quickly became a crucial part of conda-forge's infrastructure. Because of that the code needs some hardening" (testing and re-factor) to make it more reliable and less prone to break with updates.

Here are some ideas towards that goal:

1. Separate git logic from filtering and migration logic.

   Currently the filtering and migration logic (which is common to regular and mini migrators) is coupled to the git/github logic via the class structure. We might consider separating this. This would make testing simpler, since we could test the git logic independently of the actual migration logic. It would also reduce the amount of code we keep.

2. Refactor `auto_tick.xsh`
   It would be great to refactor auto_tick.xsh. I the main thing that needs to happen is the break up of the run function. Since it does everything, from cloning the bot's fork to issuing the PR we have rather limited opportunities to parallelize parts of the execution. For instance, we might make all but the GH API bits run in parallel, since they are mostly IO bound. However, we want to limit our exposure to the GH API so we don't run into timeouts and such.

3. Make the usage of "bad" in the case where we fail to retrieve versions consistent  
   with the other uses of "bad" which use dicts

4. Cleaning up the code

   Write documentation, API docs, move R specific things to compiler rebuild, etc.

5. Commit JSON after every feedstock PR issued?

6. Integration testing

   Run true integration (with a dev graph to boot) so we don't blow up the graph by accident and can run CIs with close to 100% coverage.

7. Separate IO from computation

   There are a few examples in the code where computation and IO are merged (for instance get_attrs in make_graph). These should be separated with IO performed elsewhere if possible. This will help the functions be more atomic and enable more workflows than the current workflow (eg pulling feedstock information from a local dir)
