2020 in Review
==============

As 2020 winds down, the Core team thought it'd be fun to review some of the big accomplishments our community has made this year.


Strong Growth
-------------

The ``conda-forge`` community has grown immensely this year. Here are a few statistics that measure our growth.

 - The community has added 3751 new unique conda packages this year, along with a corresponding number of new feedstocks.
 - For the majority of 2020, the ``conda-forge`` channel on ``anaconda.org`` exceeded 100 million downloads per month.
 - In July of 2020, the ``conda-forge`` channel passed 2 billion total downloads.
 - We've built an active community, adding seven new members to the conda-forge Core team and at least two members to the staged-recipes
   team. We've also exceeded 2,500 recipe maintainers in the ``conda-forge`` GitHub organization.

Big New Features
----------------

We've shipped many big updates to our core infrastructure this year. These updates include the move to ``R`` 4.0, the new
CentOS 7 sysroot for our compilers, completing the Python 3.8 migration, and the move of our compiler versions to GCC 9
and clang 11. Finally, we've added our first completely cross-compiler platform, ``osx-arm64`` targeting Apple Silicon.


Our growth and expanded feature set would not have been possible without the active participation and support of our community of
feedstock maintainers. We know this year has been extremely difficult for so many of our community members. **Thank you everyone
so much for the work you put into making conda-forge the wonderful, community-led resource it is today.**

We wish everyone a happy, healthy, equitable, and peaceful new year!
